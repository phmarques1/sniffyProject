    <h2>3. Why did you build Fastgrep?</h2>
    <p class="content">After using Slack for quite a while, we realized that it's not unusual to have files and, especially, links buried into the workspace. As people rely more and more on Slack for their teams' communication, it's easy to lose track of what (and who) shared what (and when). At the end of the day, we're on a mission to fight information overload and help people focus on what matters the most: working productively, FOMO-free.</p>

    <h2>4. What information does Fastgrep collect about my Slack workspace?</h2>
    <p class="content">Fastgrep does not have access to any information outside of the channels it has been invited to. Once it is invited to a channel, and the requested permissions have been authorised, Fastgrep listens to message events from the channel.<br><br>If and only if a message event contains a link or a file, Fastgrep stores the event, fetches metadata about it and saves it as a "Link" or "File" ("Link" if the message event contains a link and "File" if the message event contains a file).<br><br>If a message event doesn’t contain any link or file, no information will be stored. If it does, however, we'll save the following information regarding the message event: (a) user id, (b) username, (c) team id, (d) team name, (e) channel id, (f) channel name and (g) a link to a website or a private link to a file so that Fastgrep can list it, and (h) the date that the message event was created.</p>

    <h2>5. What do we do with the data we collect?</h2>
    <p class="content">The information Fastgrep collects from your workspace is used solely to display a list of links or files that have been shared on the channels that Fastgrep has been invited to. Links and files shared on your Slack workspace are your own and we keep it that way. Additionally, your data is never mixed with anyone else's and Fastgrep does not expose any email addresses acquired from Slack, or use them for marketing purposes.</p>
