    <h2>1. What is Fastgrep and how does it work?</h2>
    <p class="content">Fastgrep is an app (bot) built for Slack that helps teams more easily find and organize links and files shared by their team members across their workspace. All you need to do is add Fastgrep to Slack, invite it to a channel and it will start listening (monitoring) links and files that are shared on such channel.<br><br>By typing <span class="command">/links</span> or <span class="command">/files</span> in any channel that Fastgrep has been invited to, it will list the most recent links or files shared within that channel. If more than 10 links or files have been shared in the last 30 days, you can contextually ask Fastgrep to show a complete list via DM. Alternatively, you may also directly DM Fastgrep using the same commands mentioned above.<br><br>To make it even easier for you to find and organize links and files, it's also possible to filter the list items by user or channel.</p>

    <h2>2. How do I invite Fastgrep to a channel?</h2>
    <p class="content">You can invite Fastgrep to a channel by typing <span class="command">/invite @Fastgrep</span> in any channel or by sending any other regular message that contains <span class="command">@Fastgrep</span>. You'll be then prompted to add Fastgrep to the channel.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>3. Why did you build Fastgrep?</h2>
    <p class="content">After using Slack for quite a while, we realized that it's not unusual to have files and, especially, links buried into the workspace. As people rely more and more on Slack for their teams' communication, it's easy to lose track of what (and who) shared what (and when). At the end of the day, we're on a mission to fight information overload and help people focus on what matters the most: working productively, FOMO-free.</p>

    <h2>4. What information does Fastgrep collect about my Slack workspace?</h2>
    <p class="content">Fastgrep does not have access to any information outside of the channels it has been invited to. Once it is invited to a channel, and the requested permissions have been authorised, Fastgrep listens to message events from the channel.<br><br>If and only if a message event contains a link or a file, Fastgrep stores the event, fetches metadata about it and saves it as a "Link" or "File" ("Link" if the message event contains a link and "File" if the message event contains a file).<br><br>If a message event doesn’t contain any link or file, no information will be stored. If it does, however, we'll save the following information regarding the message event: (a) user id, (b) username, (c) team id, (d) team name, (e) channel id, (f) channel name and (g) a link to a website or a private link to a file so that Fastgrep can list it, and (h) the date that the message event was created.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>5. What do we do with the data we collect?</h2>
    <p class="content">The information Fastgrep collects from your workspace is used solely to display a list of links or files that have been shared on the channels that Fastgrep has been invited to. Links and files shared on your Slack workspace are your own and we keep it that way. Additionally, your data is never mixed with anyone else's and Fastgrep does not expose any email addresses acquired from Slack, or use them for marketing purposes.</p>
